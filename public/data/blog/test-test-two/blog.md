# A Gentle Start to the Week

Yoinked from gen AI

There are few things as universally uplifting as waking up to the sound of quiet sunshine spilling through the window. Today, the sky has traded its usual grey for a calm blue, dotted with a few slow-moving clouds that seem in no particular hurry to be anywhere.

The streets are still damp from last night’s brief drizzle, but the air carries that cool freshness that follows a good rain. Even the birds sound more confident this morning, as though they, too, noticed the difference.

Later in the afternoon, the warmth will linger long enough for a walk, perhaps even a stop at the park bench that always catches the best of the light. It’s the sort of day that asks for nothing in return — just that you take a moment to notice it.

If every week began this way, we might all be just a little more forgiving of Mondays.
