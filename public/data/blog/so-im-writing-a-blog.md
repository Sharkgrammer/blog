# The importance of deadlines

You don't realise until they're gone just how important deadlines are to your productivity. 

When it comes to personal projects and learning I've found lately that it hard to put the work into it. It's very easy to claim that you'll work on something in a future that never comes.

So once a week, I have a deadline to put something up here. Having a deadline to write something about an interesting topic in tech, design or my lovely houseplants should do my poor brain great.
